Tool\+DAQ is an open source general modular DAQ Frame\+Work, with built in service discovery and serialisation. It is based on the Tool\+Framework \href{https://github.com/ToolFramework/ToolFramework}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Tool\+Framework/\+Tool\+Framework}}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{$\ast$\+PLEASE NOTE\+: This is the core framework only!!! do not clone this repo for building your own application.}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
To create your own Tool\+DAQ appliciaion please clone/fork the Tool\+Application repository \href{https://github.com/ToolFramework/ToolApplication}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Tool\+Framework/\+Tool\+Application}} which has a script {\ttfamily Get\+Tool\+DAQ.\+sh} to pull this repository down as a dependancy and set up everything for you.

The main executable creates a Tool\+Chain which is an object that holds Tools. Tools are added to the Tool\+Chain and then the Tool\+Chain can be told to Initialise Execute and Finalise each tool in the chain.

The Tool\+Chain also holds a uesr defined \mbox{\hyperlink{classDataModel}{Data\+Model}} which each tool has access too and can read ,update and modify. This is the method by which data is passed between Tools.

User Tools can be generated for use in the tool chain by incuding a Tool header. This can be done manually or by use of the new\+Tool.\+sh script.
